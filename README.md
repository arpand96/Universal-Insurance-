**Business Problem:**

Universal Insurance is facing a significant business problem with its call-center operations. After a successful advertising campaign, the company experienced a sales increase of over 15 percent, resulting in a surge of more than 25,000 phone calls per month to their call centers. Unfortunately, this influx of calls has led to a decline in customer service quality, as representatives often lack the necessary knowledge to address customer inquiries effectively. To tackle this issue, the company needs to identify the root cause. Potential factors that could be contributing to the problem include training deficiencies, inadequate hiring standards, insufficient employee salaries, or a website that fails to provide adequate information. Determining the primary issue will allow the company to allocate its resources appropriately for improvement.
